You are a senior product engineer. Extend the Lead Management App with NOTIFICATIONS and ROLE-BASED USER MANAGEMENT permissions as defined below.

FEATURE 1: NOTIFICATIONS SYSTEM
Implement a centralized notifications module with real-time alerts and reminders.

Notification triggers:
1) New lead assigned
   - When Admin assigns a lead to a Manager → notify the Manager
   - When Manager assigns a lead to an Executive → notify the Executive

2) Follow-up reminders
   - Notify Executive on the follow-up date (same day reminder)
   - Notify Executive and Manager if follow-up becomes overdue
   - Optional: notify Admin for overdue follow-ups older than X days

Notification delivery:
- In-app notifications (mandatory)
- Push notification ready (mobile-first)
- Each notification includes: title, message, related lead, timestamp, read/unread state

Notification data model:
- id
- user_id
- type (LEAD_ASSIGNED, FOLLOW_UP_REMINDER, OVERDUE)
- title
- message
- lead_id (nullable)
- is_read (boolean)
- created_at (DateTime)

FEATURE 2: USER MANAGEMENT PERMISSIONS (RBAC)

Admin Permissions:
- Add, edit, activate, deactivate, and remove ALL users (Admins, Managers, Executives)
- Assign or reassign Managers to Executives
- View and manage all user profiles
- Full override permissions across the system

Manager Permissions:
- Add new Executives under their own team only
- Edit or remove Executives assigned to them
- Activate / deactivate their Executives
- Managers CANNOT:
  - Add or remove Admins
  - Add or remove other Managers
  - Modify Executives belonging to another Manager

Executive Permissions:
- Cannot add, edit, or remove any users
- Can only manage assigned leads

VALIDATION RULES (IMPORTANT)
- When a Manager creates an Executive, automatically link executive.manager_id = manager.id
- Prevent Managers from accessing user records outside their team
- Prevent deletion of users who have active leads unless reassigned or deactivated
- All add/remove actions must be logged in an audit log with user_id, action, target_user_id, timestamp

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Admin User Management Screen:
  - Tabs: Admins | Managers | Executives
  - Actions: Add, Edit, Deactivate, Remove
- Manager User Management Screen:
  - Only shows Executives under that Manager
  - Actions: Add Executive, Edit, Deactivate, Remove
- Executives do NOT see any user management UI

DELIVERABLES
Provide:
1) Updated database schema
2) Permission matrix (Admin vs Manager vs Executive)
3) Notification triggers & logic
4) API endpoints for user management & notifications
5) Edge-case handling and security validations

Implement with secure RBAC, clean UI, and production-ready validation.
