ISSUE: I cannot see “Add / Remove” buttons and “Teams” access in the UI.

FIX THIS COMPLETELY by implementing role-based navigation + pages + buttons.
Do NOT only write permissions in text—MAKE THE UI VISIBLE.

1) REQUIRED PAGES + ROUTES
Create these pages and ensure they are reachable from the sidebar:
- ADMIN: /admin/users  (User Management)
- MANAGER: /manager/team (Team Management)

2) SIDEBAR / MENU MUST BE ROLE-BASED
Show menu items based on currentUser.role:
- If role == ADMIN:
  show “Users” (link /admin/users) and “Dashboard”
- If role == MANAGER:
  show “Team” (link /manager/team) and “Dashboard”
- If role == EXECUTIVE:
  show ONLY “Leads”, “Notifications”, “Dashboard” (no team/users)

3) BUTTON VISIBILITY (CRITICAL)
- On /admin/users:
  show buttons Add / Edit / Deactivate / Remove for ALL roles (Admins, Managers, Executives)
  ONLY if currentUser.role == ADMIN

- On /manager/team:
  show buttons Add Executive / Edit / Deactivate / Remove Executive
  ONLY if currentUser.role == MANAGER
  Manager can only manage executives whose manager_id == currentUser.id

4) BACKEND/API MUST ENFORCE SAME RBAC
Even if someone hits API directly:
- ADMIN can create/remove any user
- MANAGER can create/remove ONLY executives with manager_id = currentUser.id
- EXECUTIVE cannot create/remove users

5) AUTH STATE MUST LOAD ROLE CORRECTLY
After login:
- Fetch user profile from DB: id, role, is_active
- Store it in app state (currentUser)
- Do NOT default role to EXECUTIVE
- If role is missing, show blocking error “User role not set. Contact admin.”

6) DATA MODEL REQUIRED
users table must have:
- id, name, email/mobile, role (ADMIN|MANAGER|EXECUTIVE), is_active, manager_id (nullable)

Rules:
- Executive must have manager_id set
- When Manager creates Executive => automatically set manager_id = manager.id

DELIVERABLE:
After fix:
- Admin can see “Users” menu + Add/Remove buttons
- Manager can see “Team” menu + Add/Remove Executive buttons
- Executive cannot see these menus/buttons
