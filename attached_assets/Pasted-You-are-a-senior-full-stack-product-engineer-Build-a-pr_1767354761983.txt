You are a senior full-stack product engineer. Build a production-ready Lead Management App (mobile-first + web) with RBAC, separate login sections, lead assignment, follow-ups, dashboard, and notifications.

1) ROLES (RBAC)
- Admin: full access, manage users (Managers, Executives), view all leads + analytics, configure sources/service types, assign/reassign leads, audit logs.
- Manager: view leads of their executives, manual assign/reassign, monitor performance dashboards.
- Executive: view only assigned leads, update status, add notes, set follow-up dates, receive reminders.

2) AUTH + SEPARATE LOGIN SECTIONS (IMPORTANT)
Create 3 separate login pages/sections:
- /login/admin
- /login/manager
- /login/executive
Each login only allows that role. If a user tries wrong portal, show: “Unauthorized portal for this account.”
Also add a unified “Choose Role” landing page with 3 buttons to open the correct login.

Store user table with:
- id, name, mobile/email, role (enum: ADMIN, MANAGER, EXECUTIVE), password hash, is_active, created_at, last_login_at
Managers have executives mapping:
- manager_id -> executive_id (many executives per manager)

3) LEAD FIELDS (Data Model)
Leads must include:
- name (string, required)
- mobile (string, required, validation: 10 digits; unique optional)
- service_type (enum or string, required)
- city (string, required)
- source (enum or string, required)

System fields:
- id
- assigned_to (executive_id, nullable until assigned)
- assigned_by (admin/manager id)
- status (enum: NEW, FOLLOW_UP, CONVERTED, CLOSED) default NEW
- follow_up_at (DATETIME, nullable)  ✅ MUST be Date/DateTime type, not string
- created_at (DATETIME)
- updated_at (DATETIME)

4) FEATURES
A) Add Lead
- Form to create lead with required validations.
- On create: status = NEW, created_at auto.
- Option: auto-assign ON/OFF.

B) Assignment
- Auto-assign: Round-robin among active executives (optionally within a manager’s team).
- Manual assign: Admin/Manager selects executive.
- Reassign allowed only for Admin/Manager; keep reassignment history.

C) Status Workflow
- NEW -> FOLLOW_UP -> (CONVERTED or CLOSED)
Rules:
- If status is FOLLOW_UP, follow_up_at is REQUIRED and must be a valid DateTime.
- If status is CONVERTED or CLOSED, editing is restricted (only Admin can edit; Manager/Executive read-only except adding a final note if allowed).

D) Notes + Follow-up
Create a LeadNotes table:
- id, lead_id, note_text, created_by_user_id, created_at (DATETIME)
Notes should be shown as a timeline.

5) DASHBOARD
Admin/Manager dashboard cards:
- Total leads
- Today follow-ups (count of leads where follow_up_at is today AND status=FOLLOW_UP)
- Executive-wise performance table:
  - executive name
  - leads assigned
  - follow-ups due today
  - converted count
  - closed count

Executive dashboard:
- My total assigned
- Today follow-ups
- Overdue follow-ups

6) NOTIFICATIONS
- Trigger when new lead assigned: notify executive immediately (in-app + push-ready)
- Follow-up reminders:
  - Morning reminder for today’s follow-ups
  - Overdue reminder for past follow_up_at that are not completed
Store notifications table:
- id, user_id, type, title, message, related_lead_id, is_read, created_at

7) FIX THE “expected date, received string” ERROR (CRITICAL)
Follow_up field MUST be stored and processed as Date/DateTime, not string.

Implement:
- UI DateTime Picker that returns a Date object (or ISO string that is parsed into DateTime before saving).
- Backend validation: if follow_up_at is provided, parse it into DateTime.
- If invalid, return error: “Follow-up date must be a valid date/time.”
- When sending via API, use ISO 8601 format: 2026-01-02T10:30:00Z (or with local timezone).
- Database column type:
  - SQL: TIMESTAMP / DATETIME
  - Firebase: Timestamp
  - Mongo: Date

Also ensure:
- Any schema uses follow_up_at as date type:
  - Zod: z.coerce.date() (if using strings from form)
  - Yup: yup.date().required() when status=FOLLOW_UP
  - Prisma: DateTime
  - Mongoose: Date

8) SCREENS (Minimum)
- Role selection page
- Admin login, Manager login, Executive login
- Leads list with filters (status, city, source, executive, date)
- Add lead screen
- Lead detail screen (status update, notes, follow-up picker)
- Assignment screen (admin/manager)
- Dashboard screen
- Notifications screen

9) OUTPUT REQUIRED FROM YOU
Generate:
- Database schema (tables/collections)
- API endpoints (CRUD + assignment + dashboard + notifications)
- Permission matrix for each role
- Frontend screen list + key components
- Validation rules that prevent date-string errors

Build it with clean UI, fast search, pagination, and secure RBAC.
