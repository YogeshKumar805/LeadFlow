BUG/ISSUE:
I cannot see the “Add Executive / Remove Executive” access in the UI.
Fix the RBAC + UI so the correct buttons and pages appear for Admin and Manager.

REQUIREMENTS (MUST IMPLEMENT):

1) USER MANAGEMENT PAGES (MUST EXIST)
Create these pages and add them to the navigation:

A) Admin users management:
- Route: /admin/users
- Visible in sidebar/menu ONLY if role == ADMIN
- Tabs: Admins | Managers | Executives
- Actions (buttons): Add, Edit, Deactivate, Remove (Delete)
- Admin can add/remove ANY role (admin/manager/executive)

B) Manager team management:
- Route: /manager/team
- Visible in sidebar/menu ONLY if role == MANAGER
- Shows ONLY executives under that manager
- Actions (buttons): Add Executive, Edit, Deactivate, Remove Executive
- Manager can add/remove ONLY executives in their own team

Executives must NOT see any user management page or buttons.

2) UI VISIBILITY (CRITICAL)
Buttons must be conditionally rendered:
- Show “Add User / Remove User” ONLY for ADMIN on /admin/users
- Show “Add Executive / Remove Executive” ONLY for MANAGER on /manager/team
- If role mismatch, hide the page from nav AND block direct access with “403 Unauthorized”.

3) PERMISSIONS ENFORCEMENT (BACKEND/API MUST ALSO ENFORCE)
Even if UI hides buttons, API must block unauthorized actions:

- ADMIN can:
  - create/update/deactivate/remove any user
  - create/update/deactivate/remove managers & executives
- MANAGER can:
  - create executive where executive.manager_id = current_manager.id
  - update/deactivate/remove ONLY executives with executive.manager_id = current_manager.id
- EXECUTIVE can:
  - no user management actions

4) DATA MODEL (MUST SUPPORT TEAM OWNERSHIP)
Users table fields:
- id, name, mobile/email, role (ADMIN|MANAGER|EXECUTIVE), is_active, manager_id (nullable), created_at

Rules:
- For EXECUTIVE, manager_id is REQUIRED.
- When Manager creates Executive, set manager_id automatically.

5) API ENDPOINTS (REQUIRED)
- POST /admin/users (ADMIN only) -> create any user
- DELETE /admin/users/:id (ADMIN only) -> remove any user
- POST /manager/executives (MANAGER only) -> create executive under self
- DELETE /manager/executives/:id (MANAGER only) -> remove executive under self
- GET /admin/users (ADMIN only)
- GET /manager/executives (MANAGER only)

6) COMMON BUG FIXES TO APPLY
- Ensure role is stored as ENUM and read correctly after login.
- Ensure after login you fetch the current user profile (role) and store it in auth state.
- Ensure navigation menu is built from role-based config.
- Ensure no hardcoded “Executive” default role.
- Ensure separate login routes assign correct role context.

DELIVERABLE:
Update UI navigation + pages + buttons so I can clearly see Add/Remove options:
- Admin sees /admin/users with Add/Remove for all roles
- Manager sees /manager/team with Add/Remove for executives only
- Executive sees none of these
